The XUUDB server is an Attribute Source implementation which can be used by UNICORE
servers. It is used to map a UNICORE identity (an X500 distinguished name) to 
authorisation and incarnation attributes.
The XUUDB is also capable of performing dynamic mappings of incarnation attributes, 
using a rule engine.
